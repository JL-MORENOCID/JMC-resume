Born in Leganés and living in Fuenlabrada (Madrid), I started with a windows95 computer at my 6 years old, touching everything to see how it's works, then playing and coding in games like Minecraft at my 12th where my career starts for me. I love to create and tend to keep a few too many projects on the go at a time. Outside of work I like to train at gym and eat well. I love to travel to new places and discover another cultures.",
